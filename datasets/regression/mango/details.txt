DATA USED IN THE REGRESSION TUTORIAL:

The data set used in this study has a total of 11,691 NIR spectra (684–990 ​nm in 3 ​nm sampling with a total 103 variables) 
and Dry Matter (DM %) measurements performed on 4675 mango fruit across 4 harvest seasons 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
The provided data set has been cleaned by removing a few outliers from the original data by using Hotelling’s T2 and Q 
statistics from a PLS decomposition. Final number of spectra is 11,362.
