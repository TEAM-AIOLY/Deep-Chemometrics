This data set consists of 80 samples of corn measured on 3 different NIR spectrometers. The wavelength range is 1100-2498nm at 2 nm intervals (700 channels). 
The moisture, oil, protein and starch values for each of the samples is also included. 
A number of NBS glass standards were also measured on each instrument. The data was originally taken at Cargill. Many thanks for Mike Blackburn for letting us distribute it.

The data is stored as DataSet Objects as described below:
