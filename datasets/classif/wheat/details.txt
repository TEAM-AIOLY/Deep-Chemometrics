DATA USED IN THE CLASSIFICATION TUTORIAL:

The wheat dataset shared here is a copy of the original dataset available at https://github.com/L-Zhou17/Wheat-kernels
It contains a NIR spectral dataset of wheat kernels of 30 varieties. 
Columns 1 to 200 correspond to the spectral variables and the last column contains the varieties labels. 975â€“1,645 nm
According to the instructions of the authors (Zhou et al 2020), 
i) DT_train-1.csv,DT_train-2.csv,DT_train-3.csv,DT_train-4.csv,DT_train-5.csv, are concatenated (vertically) and redifined as training data
ii) The same is used to create the validation set from 'DT_val#.csv', files and
iii) the test set from 'DT_test#.csv' files.

File names: DT_###.csv
File types: Comma Separated Values (.csv)
